    <ul>
      <li>Although humans see reality in colour, for me, black and white has always been connected to the image's deeper truth, to its most hidden meaning.</li>
      <li>I'm firmly convinced that true beauty only springs from the acceptance of oneself, from an awareness of who we really are.</li>
      <li>If photographers are responsible for creating or reflecting an image of women in society, then, I must say, there is only one way for the future, and this is to define women as strong and independent. This should be the responsibility of photographers today: to free women, and finally everyone, from the terror of youth and perfection.</li>
      <li>Photography gives you the opportunity to use your sensibility and everything you are to say something about and be part of the world around you. In this way, you might discover who you are, and with a little luck, you might discover something much larger than yourself.</li>
      <li>With the indiscriminate touching-up of photos, we've grown accustomed to seeing personalities drained of all their humanity, yet we consider them as real.</li>
